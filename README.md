# Gemini Multimodal RAG Applications with LangChain 
## This notebook tries to replicate the notebook from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxF8-ay9Bzk (Google Cloud Events) with some adaptations.
Use at your own risk ðŸ˜†. You won't need to pay for any service.

The changes are: 
  - The vectorstore is changed(adapted) to Atlas mongoDB
  - Instead of VertexAI, it is used langchain-google-genai to access models(llm chat and embedding)
  - the code is not completely the same. It has some minor changes like variable names, etc.
